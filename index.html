            <h2>Introduction to Project</h2>
            <p style = "width: 90%;"> Our project aims to analyze crime data collected from the Boston Crime Database in order to uncover patterns and insights that can inform public safety 
              and assist policy measures. The motivation to look into Boston crime data is to better understand where and when crime takes place. Crime is persistent in urban areas, and 
              understanding crime from an analytical point of view can inform decisions that save many peopleâ€™s lives. We found one report online named "Analysis of Boston Crime Incident Data: 
              Exploring Crime Patterns and Trends" and while they did a compelling analysis, they lacked the depth that we wanted to pursue. We also examined another project online called "Deep Dive: Crime 
              in Boston" by Sunshine Chen, but this project only looked at crime by neighborhoods in Boston, and we wanted to draw more insights from our data. By examining crime trends, such as location hotspots, time patterns, 
              and crime types, we can potentially identify areas for intervention, resource allocation, and community support programs. This research is significant as it can help shape 
              future crime prevention strategies and improve the quality of life for Boston's residents.

            <h2>Intro to Data</h2>
            <p style="width: 90%;">
              Our dataset comes from the Boston Crime Database from the dates of 2015 to 2018, and it contains a comprehensive set of data points for analysis. 
              The dataset had 327,821 rows and contained 17 columns. These are some major data points in our dataset:
            </p>
            <ul style="width: 90%;">
              <li><strong>Offense Code Group:</strong> This categorical data contains information about what the crime was classified as (for example, Aggravated Assault, Vandalism, etc) on the police report. This data is extremely helpful when grouping crimes of a similar nature to reveal insightful patterns.</li>
              <li><strong>District:</strong> Which Boston district the crime occurred in and allows us to look into geographical trends and distribution of crime across the city.</li>
              <li><strong>Shooting:</strong> This binary variable denotes whether a shooting was involved in the crime. A value of "Y" indicates that the crime involved a shooting, while a blank field suggests that no shooting was involved.</li>
              <li><strong>Year:</strong> What year the crime occurred in.</li>
              <li><strong>Month:</strong> Which month the crime occurred in.</li>
              <li><strong>Day of the Week:</strong> Which day of the week the crime occurred in.</li>
              <li><strong>Hour:</strong> Which hour of the day the crime occurred in.</li>
              <li><strong>Street:</strong> What street the crime occurred on.</li>
              <li><strong>Location (Latitude and Longitude):</strong> Contained latitude and longitude coordinates of where the crime occurred.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="width: 90%;">
              Together, these data points provide a multifaceted view of criminal activity in Boston, enabling us to explore geographic and temporal trends to specific types of offenses. 
              Through this dataset, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that can contribute to a deeper understanding of crime patterns in the city.
