          <h1>Crimes by Different Districts</h1>
          <iframe src="crime_map.html" width="800" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
          <p> Generally, the most important thing to know about a crime is where you are in relation to it. This visualization is designed to show where crimes are committed on a district-by-district
             basis intuitively. Another important thing to know, although probably not as critical for a concerned citizen, is the number of crimes that occur in each district. Thus, the tooltip and 
             selection utility for this visualization allows the user to identify the number of crimes that occurred in each district.
          </p>
          <p> The most crimes occur in Roxbury. Downtown did not contain as many crimes. Areas closer to the center of the city (more populated) tended to have more crime than those further from the 
            city (less populated). 
         </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "A">
          <h1>Crime by Street</h1>
          <iframe src="all_offense_bar.html" width="800" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
          <p> When moving through a city, knowing which streets are safe and which streets are not is key to avoiding any crime. This visualization helps with determining outlier streets that may be 
            unsafe, as well as allowing an analyst to highlight specific streets or crimes that need to be addressed in policy or via targeted policing. 
          </p>
          <p> The graph identifies several major streets that have a larger proportion of several selected crimes. For example, Washington St. and Boylston St. both have significantly more crime than 
            several of the other streets with larger crime totals, such as Blue Hill Ave. or Newbury St. Notably, Washington St. has significantly more occurrences of Aggravated Assault compared to 
            Boylston St. Newbury St. also has very few instances of Robbery or Aggravated Assault, which is notable compared to similar roads like Blue Hill or Huntington.
          </p>

        <div class = "A">
          <h1>Crime Rates Over Time</h1>
          <div id="lineplot"></div>
          <select id="crimeFilter"></select>

          <script src='templete.js'></script> 
          <p> Crime statistics, just like population or voter registration rolls, change year over year. Visualizing the overall crime data for Boston yearly allows a data analyst or policy maker to determine 
            if a new policy is positively affecting the community. For example, a visualization of crime before and after the implementation of broken-windows policing could allow a politician to determine if 
            the crime-fighting tactic is useful. Additionally, crime specific filtering allows tailored policy-making for each subset of crime, as well as indicating general crime trends like increased poverty
             leading to larger robbery reports or increased organized crime being potentially correlated with homicides or drug offenses.  
            </p>
            <p> The overall trend of crime is up from around 52,500 crimes in 2015 to 90,000 in 2016. This trend then leveled and then decreased in 2018. Many crimes followed this pattern such as aggravated 
              assaults and robberies. Some crimes did not follow this path however such as bomb hoaxes which saw a peak in 2016 then a big decrease in 2017. Some crimes did not happen every year such as 
              Manslaughter which saw 5 cases in 2016, and just followed by 4 in 2017.

          <h1>Crime by Weekday</h1>
          <iframe src="weekly_bar_chart.html" width="800" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
          <p> Weekday visualization allows analysts and citizens alike to observe trends and commonalities across different crimes over the week. This graph ensures that there are only 7 major bars to keep track of
             and allows a visualist to identify both the most common crimes on each weekday but also the total number of crimes on each weekday, useful for adaptive police-work or for ensuring transit or group plans 
             are as safe as possible.  
            </p>
            <p> Overall, crime trends to around 40 thousand occurrences Monday-Friday, with Thursday being the lowest weekday-crime day outside of the weekend. Thursday ties with Saturday for weekend crimes, while 
              Sunday has the lowest crime overall by around 5 thousand reported crimes. Notably, the most common crime overall is “Motor Vehicle Accident Response”. The second most common crime(that is a crime) is
               Larceny, meaning theft, closely followed by Medical Assistance - again another 911 code and Investigate Person, which indicates the police performing an investigation into an individual for other issues
                or crimes. Notably, Sunday reports far fewer administrative police tasks, like warrant arrests or missing person reports filed.
             </p>

            <h1>Crime Comparison Across District</h1>
            <iframe src="chart.html" width="800" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
            <p> Scatterplots are useful to display correlations between various continuous variables. Thus, the utility of the scatterplot for comparing correlations between various crimes is self-evident. A scatterplot 
              of crime vs. crime data allows an analyst to see overall trends around crimes for the sake of determining if a policy reducing robberies might increase drug offenses or vice versa, as well as determining 
              if there are outlier districts that have specifically higher or lower rates of individual crimes, opening avenues for investigation.
            </p>
            <p> Most crimes appear to either follow a positive and mostly linear trend (meaning one crime is associated with another crime) like Fraud vs. Larceny or are unrelated like Other Burglary vs. Ballistics. Notably, 
              there are some interesting outlier cases, like Aircraft vs. Any, where East Boston is guaranteed to be an outlier. This is self-explanatory when you factor in the information that Boston Logan Airport is 
              situated in the East Boston district, meaning that aircraft offenses are nearly guaranteed to occur there over other districts like Roxbury. Gambling is another interesting case, with many districts reporting 
              few if any cases while others, specifically Jamaica Plain and Dorchester, report many more. Notably, this crime group doesn’t follow the overall criminality trend of districts, where Roxbury has the most crime.
