          <h1>Crimes by District</h1>
          <iframe src="crime_map.html" width="800" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
          <p> The most crimes occur in Roxbury, while the least crimes occur in the Downtown. This follows from the logical assumption that Downtown is first policed heavily and second has a lower 
            population(and thus a lower amount of opportunities to commit crime) than most of the other districts. Additionally, the amount of crime follows closely with the population density of 
            each district, with less populated districts like West Roxbury, Hyde Park, and East Boston having lower crime rates than more populated districts like Roxbury, Dorchester, and South End.
            The outlier to this trend is still the Downtown district, which has a relatively high population density(compared to Hyde Park) but the lowest amount of crime.

          <iframe src="all_offense_bar.html" width="800" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
          <p> The filtered graphs identify several major streets that have larger proportion of several selected crimes. For example, Washington St. and Boylston St. both have significantly more 
            crime than several of the other streets with larger crime totals, such as Blue Hill Ave. or Newbury St. Notably, Washington St. has significantly more occurrences of Aggravated Assault 
            compared to Boylston St. Newbury St. also has very few instances of Robbery or Aggravated Assault, which is notable compared to similar roads like Blue Hill or Huntington. The unfiltered 
            graph, meanwhile, shows that Washington St. has significantly more criminal activity compared to many of the other previously comparable streets(such as Boylston St.) Additionally, many 
            of the smaller streets in the unfiltered graph are included solely because they include the Motor Vehicle Accident Response code, meaning a car accident response. Also notable are the 
            codes that occur only on major streets, indicating a larger police presence. An example is the Liquor Violation code, indicating a violation of an alcohol or liquor license. </p>

          <h1>Crime by Weekday</h1>
          <iframe src="weekly_bar_chart.html" width="800" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
          <p> Overall, crime trends to around 40 thousand occurrences Monday-Friday, with Thursday being the lowest weekday-crime day outside of the weekend. Thursday ties with Saturday for weekend crimes, 
            while Sunday has the lowest crime overall by around 5 thousand reported crimes. Notably, the most common crime overall is “Motor Vehicle Accident Response”, which is a code that indicates the 
            police responding to a car accident 911 or other similar call to the emergency services - which isn’t truly a crime. The second most common crime(that is a crime) is Larceny, meaning theft, 
            closely followed by Medical Assistance - again another 911 code and Investigate Person, which indicates the police performing an investigation into an individual for other issues or crimes. 
            Notably, Sunday reports far fewer administrative police tasks, like warrant arrests or missing person reports filed. </p>

            <h1>Crime Comparison Across District</h1>
            <iframe src="chart.html" width="800" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
            <p> Most crimes appear to either follow a positive and mostly linear trend (meaning one crime is associated with another crime) like Fraud vs. Larceny or are unrelated like Other Burglary vs. 
              Ballistics. Notably, there are some interesting outlier cases, like Aircraft vs. Any, where East Boston is guaranteed to be an outlier. This is self-explanatory when you factor in the 
              information that Boston Logan Airport is situated in the East Boston district, meaning that aircraft offenses are nearly guaranteed to occur there over other districts like Roxbury. Gambling 
              is another interesting case, with many districts reporting few if any cases while others, specifically Jamaica Plain and Dorchester, report many more. Notably, this crime group doesn’t follow
               the overall criminality trend of districts, where Roxbury has the most crime.
