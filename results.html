                <h3>Crime Analysis Summary</h3>
                <p style="width: 90%;">
                  With our analysis of Boston crime data, we found several insights in terms of crime trends, distribution, and correlation. Our visualizations underline the association between crime trends and population density across major Boston districts like Roxbury, Dorchester, and the South End. Meanwhile, the Downtown district maintained a low crime rate despite its business and relative population sizes, potentially due to elevated police presence. With this information, policymakers should target population-dense areas with anti-crime policy, and Boston residents should take care in high-crime districts. Major streets including Washington St. and Boylston St. saw elevated crime count compared to other streets of similar scale, and these streets could also be an area of focus for Boston police forces and policymakers.

                <p style="width: 90%;">
                  We also gathered insights about when crimes occur. Crimes tend to be more common during the week (Monday to Friday) compared to the weekend, including a significant dip on Sundays. This is intuitive—people avoid theft or robbery and similar crimes when many witnesses are present, like during weekends. Additionally, as crime statistics included responses to car accidents, days with large rush hour periods are likely to involve more car accidents and thus more reported incidents. We also saw that crimes peaked in 2016-2017 and then started to decline more in 2018. With this data, policymakers could see either that measures implemented in 2018 were very effective at combating crime or that long-term measures implemented in 2016 or 2017 began showing returns in 2018.

                <p style="width: 90%;">
                  Finally, we compared different categories of crimes across each other to analyze associations between various criminal activities. Most crimes trended towards a linear or otherwise positive correlation, like Robbery vs. Aggravated Assault, which is logical: many studies have shown that not only does an increase in crime lead to more poverty, leading to more crime, criminal activity like common larceny or petty theft can often lead to more serious crimes like aggravated assault or even homicide depending on the situation. Some crimes, however, have alternative distributions. Notable is the Aircraft incident code, which is almost unique to East Boston’s Logan Airport, alongside other crime vs. crime groups which appear with more isolated or situational patterns.

                <li><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> Try to forecast when crime rates are going to spike and where they might occur.</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis of Policy Measure:</strong> Analyze different policy measures to see if they had the desired impact on the crime rate in a given area of Boston.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze Socioeconomic Factors:</strong> Look at the “Why” behind the crime counts in different regions of Boston. Our dataset lacked information containing the economic factors or motives behind crimes, which could lead to more insightful results on how to prevent these crimes from reoccurring.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze Newer Data:</strong> Our dataset was limited to between 2015 and 2018. This data could have easily changed and may not be super insightful in today's context. Newer data would provide a more compelling analysis of what to do today.</li>
